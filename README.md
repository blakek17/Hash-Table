# Hash-Table
A hash table class, test program, and account login program that implements the class. The hash table uses an array of binary search trees for its collision lists.

These programs were developed collaboratively with a fellow student as an academic project. show10.cpp, test10.cpp, and password.dat were provided by the instructor.

Description of files:
HashTable.cpp and HashTable.h contain the hash table class.
BSTree.cpp and BSTree.h contain the binary search tree class used for collision lists.
test10.cpp allows users to interact with an instance of the hash table.
show10.cpp visualizes the contents of the hash table for users.
login.cpp takes the fictional username and password data from password.dat and stores it in a hash table; users type in a username and password pair and it is looked up in the hash table for authentication.
